						<p>A talk is where you present, usually with slides and demos, to an audience. The default time slot for <strong>each talk and Q&A is 35 minutes</strong> (we recommend 25-minute talk and 10-minute Q&A). <strong>A talk has one primary speaker</strong> and, optionally, a secondary speaker. Consider recruiting your colleagues to interact with people online while you are talking live at the conference.</p><p>A talk should be bite-sized and focused on a certain topic. This means that you should not expect to be able to cover multiple broad areas in one talk. You can submit more than one proposal, to cover a set of topics, but we cannot guarantee their final scheduled order. Therefore, we recommend topics be independent so that they do not need to be presented in a specific order.</p><p>If you require more than 35 minutes to cover a certain topic, there is an option to submit a two-part session (two 35-minute time slots with a 10-minute break in between) where we guarantee the order in the schedule. You should consider that different audiences may join each part and tailor the content accordingly. This option is recommended for deep technical dives that include a demo. You will be asked to specify why you require more time, each case will be evaluated individually.</p><p>Please note that this year <strong>all presentations will be delivered in person</strong>. We plan to stream talks online and make sure in-person as well as online audiences can participate in Q&A and chat.</p>

We have a <a href='/cz/speakerguide/' target='_blank'>speaker guide</a> and a <a href='/cz/speakercoachingguide' target='_blank'>speaker coaching guide</a> available to support speakers and coaches. People who sign up, will receive their coaching matches by beginning of May, with the expectation that they will schedule practice sessions between May 8 and June 2.<br><br>We ask the coaches to take the lead on scheduling the practice session via a video conference (BlueJeans, Talky.io, Jitsi Meet, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, etc). The speaker can choose to invite other audience members to the practice. In the practice session, the speaker delivers their practice talk, and the coach and other audience members provide feedback on the talk and slide deck.<br><br>Speakers and coaches agree to abide by the <a href='/coc/' target='_blank'>DevConf Code of Conduct</a> both during the conference and in any pre-conference coaching, practice, or other program related activities.</p>

						<p>Matrix servers are all federated. This means you can use another Matrix server account on the DevConf.CZ server. For this reason we don’t offer direct user registration.</p><p>Many online and open source communities host Matrix servers and offer accounts. You can also self-host. Here are some places to get an account:</p><ul><li>matrix.org - A server provided by the Matrix Foundation</li><li>Your community's server if you plan to use the account as a contributor, not just during DevConf.cz (e.g. Fedora, Mozilla etc.)</li><li>You can also find a potentially helpful list of public servers at <a href='https://joinmatrix.org/servers/' target='_blank'>https://joinmatrix.org/servers/</a></li><li>Another option is to host or self-host your own server.

Applicants who work full-time in technology, need to have worked full-time in technology for less than 5 years since the time they started full-time work in technology or resumed it after a break of six months or more due to studies or personal reasons.
