              <li>Pictures and diagrams are much better than words!</li>
              <li>Re-use visual conventions and metaphors. If you use a figure or symbol to represent some idea, re-use it everywhere you need it.
            Your audience will find it much easier to follow your narrative when they can recognize recurring ideas visually.</li>

        <div class="h2 pt-3 pb-4 mx-5 mont-700">How to do a demo during your talk</div>
        <div class="os-400 mx-5">
            <p class="os-400">
            <strong>We encourage you to pre-record any demos or special interactions you want to share with your audience.</strong> It is always better to walk through the pre-recorded coding, so nothing goes wrong while presenting live and you can focus on what you want to say to the audience.
            </p>
            <p class="os-400">Common issues that speakers usually experience during a live demo instead of pre-recording it:
            <ul>
		<li>Laptop that they tested their demo on before their live session stops working or it is not compatible with room setup and they need to use another laptop where they don’t have everything installed and ready.</li>
                <li>Internet connection fails and a demo is not possible without it.</li>
                <li>Internet connection is very slow and their demo is two times longer than they expected and they are not able to finish their slides.</li>
                <li>And many more, that is why you should consider recording it.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p class="os-400">How to pre-record a demo:
            <ul>
		        <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Make sure you have all the necessary equipment that you will need to pre-record your demo, such as a microphone, audio interface, recording software (e.g. OBS studio, SimpleScreenRecorder or Kazam), headphones, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Spend some time practicing and preparing for your recording session so that everything is perfect when it comes time to record (but you can fix a lot by editing your recording afterwards!).</li>
                <li><strong>Set Up:</strong> Connect all of your equipment together properly and make sure everything is working correctly before starting to record anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Record:</strong> Once you’ve set up your equipment and are comfortable with the material, it’s time to start recording! This is where having a pre-recorded demo can be beneficial as it allows you to focus more on performance rather than worrying about technical aspects such as audio levels or sound quality. </li>
                <li><strong>Edit:</strong> After recording your demo, you can then edit it in order to make sure everything is perfect before sharing it with others. This process involves making adjustments like cutting long pauses, compressing certain elements of the track, etc., which all help enhance the overall look of your demo. Some linux video editors are for example OpenShot, Blender or Shotcut.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p class="os-400">Common mistakes to avoid:
            <ul>
		        <li>Unexpected volume changes.</li>
                <li>Small text or icon sizes, make it as big as possible for the people in the back!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="os-400"><strong>If you don’t want to pre-record your demo, make sure you use the same hardware while preparing for your session as you plan to use at the conference.</strong></p>
