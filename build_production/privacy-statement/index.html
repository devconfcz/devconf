		     		        <p>
					 Red Hat, Inc. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries involved in organizing DevConf.info
					 events globally (collectively, “Red Hat”) respect your privacy. This Privacy Statement applies
					 to personal data collected by Red Hat through the devconf.info website, and other websites
					 which we operate and on which we post a direct link to this Privacy Statement. For some websites
					 managed by Red Hat affiliates, the affiliate may act as a controller for data collected from the
					 website. This Privacy Statement may not apply to open source project websites sponsored by Red Hat.
					 Such project websites may have their own privacy statements, which we encourage you to review.
				       </p>
					<p>
					  Please also note that co-branded websites (websites where Red Hat presents content together with one
					  or more of our business partners) may be governed by additional or different privacy statements.
					  Please refer to the privacy statement on those websites for more information about applicable privacy
					  practices.
					</p>
					<p>
					  Red Hat’s obligations with respect to personal data that may be held on behalf of customers in
					  connection with cloud services Red Hat provides, such as personal data stored by customers using our
					  OpenShift Online offering, are defined in our agreements with our customers and are not governed
					  by this Privacy Statement.
					</p>
					<p>
					  As used in this Privacy Statement, “personal data” means any information relating to an identified
					  or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be
					  identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
					  identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to
					  the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
					  person.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mont-700 mt-5">The personal data we collect</h3>
					<p>
					  Red Hat collects personal data directly from you when you interact with us through the devconf.info website,

					  this manner allows us to analyze the effectiveness of our websites and our marketing efforts, personalize your experience and improve our interactions with you. For 
					  more information about the technologies we employ for these purposes, see the “Cookies and Other Technologies” section below.
					</p>

					<p>
					  We may also supplement the personal data we collect from you with additional personal data we receive from third parties, such as your employer, our customers, and our business 
					  partners where you purchase any of our products or services through such business partners. We do this to help us improve the overall accuracy of the information and its 
					  completeness and to help us better tailor our interactions with you.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mont-700 mt-5">How we use (process) your personal data</h3>
					<p>
					  Red Hat uses personal data in an effort to enhance your experience on our websites. In addition, we may use personal data we collect about you to:
					</p>

					<ul>
					  <li>
						Identify and Authenticate You. We use your personal data to verify your identity when you access and use our Services and to ensure the security of your personal data. 
						This includes your creation of an account that is associated with your personal data. The personal data that may be collected and processed for this purpose includes: name, title, 
						company name, email address, telephone number, postal address, language, username, and password. We process this information in order to comply with our contractual (or otherwise) obligations to you.
					  </li>
					  <li>
						Fulfill Your Requests. If you request something from Red Hat, such as a product or service, a call back, a newsletter subscription, or specific marketing or other materials, we use the 
						personal data you provide to respond to your request. We or our representatives may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes. Where required 
						by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before sending marketing messages. The personal data that may be collected and processed for this purpose includes: name, title, company name, 
						email address, telephone number, postal address, language, username, payment information, purchase records, credit and billing status, and support inquiries. We process this information 
						in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you when responding to your requests. In other cases it is in our legitimate business interests to be able to provide customers and 
						prospective customers with information, goods, or services they request.
				 	  </li>
					  <li>
						Provide You with Information About Our Products, Services and Events. Red Hat may use your personal data to notify you about product and service offerings as well as events that 
						we believe may be of interest to you. Red Hat also may use your personal data to respond directly to your requests for information, including registrations for newsletters or 
						other specific requests. The personal data that may be collected and processed for this purpose includes: name, title, company name, email address, telephone number, postal address, 
						language, username, payment information, purchase records, credit and billing status, and support inquiries. It is in our legitimate business interests to be able to provide 
						customers, prospective customers, and the public with information about our products, services, and events.
					  </li>
					  <li>
						Provide Support and Customer Service. We use your personal data to provide support for products or services you have obtained from us and answer other questions. In the course of 
						providing technical support to you, we may sometimes have incidental access to data that you have provided to us or data that is located on your systems. This data may contain 
						information about you, or your organization’s business, employees, customers, partners, or suppliers. This Privacy Statement does not govern our access to or handling of this 
						information. The conditions regarding the handling and processing of that data is covered by the applicable agreement between you and Red Hat, such as our Enterprise Agreement. The 
						personal data that may be collected and processed for this purpose includes: name, title, company name, email address, telephone number, postal address, language, username, payment 
						information, purchase records, credit and billing status, and support inquiries. We process this information in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you.
					  </li>

						Process Your Participation Application. When you apply to participate in a DevConf.info event or activity, we use the personal data you provide for the purpose of assessing your 
						application, considering you for future event related opportunities and carrying out necessary functions to process your application in accordance with applicable law. Red Hat 
						will share the personal data you supply during the application process with DevConf.info event organizers as well as professionals in our business functions who are participating in 
						the application process. The personal data that may be collected, shared, and/or processed for this purpose includes: name, title, company name, email address, telephone number, postal 
						address, language, biography, personal photo, age, education, professional history and contact details. It is in our legitimate business interests to be able to review the qualifications 
						of prospective participants and perform thorough review for application assessment purposes.
					  </li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					  We will not use your personal data in a manner that is inconsistent with the purpose of its original collection, unless you have consented.
					</p>


					<h3 class="mont-700 mt-5">How we disclose your personal data</h3>
					<p>
					  Red Hat will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others without your consent.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Red Hat discloses personal data in the following ways:
					</p>

					<ul>
					  <li>
						Red Hat may disclose personal data to business partners and service providers in order to support our business operations, such as (but not limited to) fulfilling your orders, 
						following up on requests, providing support and assisting Red Hat with sales, marketing and communication initiatives. These business partners and service providers include distributors, 
						resellers, payment processors, financial service providers and institutions, materials production and shipping companies, postal or government authorities, market intelligence and 
						consulting service providers, and information technology service providers. Business partners and service providers are required by contract to keep the information received on 
						behalf of Red Hat confidential and secure and not use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided to them.
					  </li>
					  <li>
						Red Hat may disclose personal data as required by law or legal process, such as responding to a duly authorized and lawful request of a police or public authority 
						(including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), to enforce or protect the rights of Red Hat, when such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to 
						prevent physical harm or financial loss as permitted by applicable law, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
					  </li>
					  <li>
						Red Hat may also disclose personal data in the context of a business transaction involving part or all of Red Hat, such as a merger, acquisition, consolidation, or divestiture. 
						Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Red Hat’s practice to seek appropriate 
						protection for information in these types of transactions. Following such a business transaction, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal data 
						with any inquiries concerning the use of that information.
					  </li>
					</ul>


					<h3 class="mont-700 mt-5">Cookies and other technologies</h3>
					<p>
					  When you visit our websites we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, browser type and language, operating system, location, date and time. We may also use 
					  cookies to collect information as you navigate our websites. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Red Hat uses some cookies that are strictly necessary for the delivery of services on our websites. Cookies that are strictly necessary allow us to improve the safety and security 
					  of our websites, authenticate account users, allow you to access your private accounts on our websites, allow you to sign into different portions of our websites with the use of only 
					  one login, balance the traffic on our websites, and remember items in your shopping cart. Cookies that are strictly necessary are not used for marketing purposes.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Red Hat also uses cookies to improve our service to you and personalize your web browsing experience, such as by gaining a better understanding of your interests and 
					  requirements regarding our websites, our business or our products and services. Cookies that Red Hat uses to improve our services and your website experience may remember your language and 
					  site preferences, invite you to participate in surveys or evaluations, show you when you are logged into our system and allow you to remain logged-in for a period of time, help provide you 
					  with support services, remember your login information, and pre-populate forms that you have already completed.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Red Hat also uses cookies that collect information about how you use our websites, including which pages you visit, and whether you experience any errors. These cookies use aggregate 
					  information to provide statistics on how our websites are used, help us improve our websites by measuring errors, testing different designs on our websites, and helping us measure 
					  the traffic on our websites so that we can optimize our content accordingly. These cookies are used to help us improve how our websites work, understand what interests our users, 
					  and measure website quality and the effectiveness of our online advertising.
					</p>

					<p>
					  In addition, we may use remarketing technology to advertise on other websites you may visit. In doing so, a third party may place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your device and 
					  use technical information about your browser and your activity at a Red Hat website to serve advertisements to you on non-Red Hat websites.
					</p>

					<p>
					  If you do not want your information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time whether you want to accept them 
					  or not. However, you must understand that choosing to reject cookies may reduce the performance and functionality of our websites. Your browser documentation includes instructions 
					  explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility). While Red Hat websites at this time generally do 
					  not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as “do not track” instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most 
					  cookies and similar technologies through your web browser.
					</p>

					<p>
					  Red Hat also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage of our websites and interaction with emails from Red Hat (e.g., open rates, click 
					  through rates). Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to 
					  the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, Red Hat may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify Red Hat when you click on a link in 
					  the email that directs you to one of our websites. Red Hat uses web beacons to operate and improve our websites and email communications.
					</p>
