					<p><em>tldr; DevConf organizers strive to create a positive environment that adheres to our <a href="/coc">Code of Conduct</a> and respects privacy of individuals.

					<h3 class="mont-700 mt-3">Speakers and session recording</h3>
					<p>When you agree to speak at any DevConf event, you consent for your talk to be recorded in audio and possibly video format. DevConf uses screen capturing hardware 
					along with audio recording equipment to broadcast presentations.</p>

					We reserve the right to publicly distribute and publish these recordings under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 license</a> (or CC-BY-SA 4.0).</p>

					<p>Your session material, including content and recordings may be used in promotional activities and other related endeavors. This material may also appear on our DevConf 
					web site, social media channels or other digital mediums controlled by the DevConf organizers or supporting partners.</p>

					<p>As conference organizers, we cannot be all places at once and it is important for us to be able to review all material presented at the conference. 
					For this reason, you may not opt out of having your talk recorded. However, if you wish, you may request that the session video not be published to the
					 public or taken down (hidden) if otherwise already published. The organizers will, to the best of their ability, respect and honors all such requests.</p>

					<p>By default, all sessions will be streamed live and archived for future playback on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYAQDZIQGm_kPvemBc_qwg">DevConf YouTube channel</a>.</p>

					<p>All sessions are recorded by official DevConf or venue A/V staff. Additionally, you agree to permitting the recording and sharing of sessions 
					by attendees of the event at large. If you do not wish for the audience to audio/video record, you are responsible for politely asking them not to record you before you start presenting.</p>

					<h3 class="mont-700 mt-5">Staff and attendee photography</h3>
					<p>When you register to participate in DevConf events, you consent to be photographed by our official conference photographer, and to have those photographs

					<ul>
					   <li>Any photography/recording that is legally allowed in public spaces is allowed at DevConf events.</li>
					   <li>Photography/recording should be treated like other potentially harassing interpersonal interaction. That is, when one person in the interaction says “stop” 
						or “leave me alone” (etc), the interaction must end. In this case, attendees should not attempt to photograph that individual again. Additionally, please respect 
						the no-photography indicators worn by attendees.</li>
					   <li>Photography/recording should not be done in such a way as to hide from the subject that it’s happening.</li>
					   <li>The subject may inspect the photo/recording at any time and, if requested, the photo/footage/etc must be deleted immediately, upon request.</li>
					   <li>Those who are taking photographs and/or recording must also follow our general Code of Conduct.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We will do our best to not make or share photos, videos or audio recordings public which could cause harm to the individuals shown/heard on them. If you do find 
					such pictures/videos/audio recordings on one of our sites or accounts, please write to our <a href="mailto:info@devconf.cz">info@devconf.cz</a>,
