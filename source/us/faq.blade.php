A talk is  either <strong>25 minutes (including 5 minutes Q&A) or 50 minutes (including 10 minutes Q&A) long</strong>, make sure you reserve time at the end for Q&A. If speakers wish to continue with the <strong>Q&A</strong> after their time slot, there will be a dedicated place for it. A talk has one primary speaker, optionally another (secondary) speaker.</p><p><strong>A talk should be bite-sized and focused</strong> on a certain topic. This means that you should not expect to be able to cover multiple broad areas in one talk. You can submit more than one proposal, to cover a set of topics, but we cannot guarantee their final scheduled order. Therefore, we recommend topics be structured in a way so as to minimize their interdependence so that they do not need to be presented in a specific order."),

It is more interactive than a talk because you could engage with the audience during the session. If you are willing to open the discussion to attendees, consider holding a fishbowl discussion where you start with a group of speakers and an empty “seat” which could be filled by active audience members in the course of a discussion.</p><p>A discussion is <strong>55 minutes long</strong>. If speakers wish to continue after the 55-minute slot, there will be a dedicated place for it. A discussion has a dedicated moderator and <strong>up to 5 active speakers</strong>"),

The goal of a workshop is to teach or practice a skill. You should not expect the audience following each step of the workshop live, however, they should have all necessary instructions if they wish to. As a result workshops should be actionable and goal oriented.</p><p>We allow <strong>up to 3 active presenters</strong> in a workshop. You must designate one of them to be the primary session leader. Feel free to recruit your colleagues to interact with people in the audience while you are talking."),

The speaker can choose to invite other audience members to the practice. In the practice session, the speaker delivers their practice talk, and the coach and other audience members provide feedback on the talk and slide deck. <br><br>Speakers and coaches agree to abide by the <a href='/coc/' target='_blank'>DevConf Code of Conduct</a> both during the conference and in any pre-conference coaching, practice, or other program related activities."),

The coach will contact the apprentice prior to the conference to arrange a virtual meeting prior to attending the conference via a video conference (BlueJeans, Talky.io, Jitsi Meet, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, etc) or a voice call. This meeting will give you a chance to exchange introductions, answer any questions the apprentice has as they prepare to attend the conference, learn about the apprentice's career goals, review the conference schedule together, and plan to attend some sessions together.
