Hi everyone, are you also getting excited about [DevConf.cz](https://www.devconf.info/cz) starting soon? Well, let me raise that bar even more and share with you my take on this year's keynotes! Keynotes are always talks where we want to open the day up for follow up sessions and discussions. And I think with both keynotes this year and the AI panel discussion, we will for sure trigger many discussions through the rest of the conference. 

### 1st Day Keynote - Fine-tuning our way towards openness in AI

[The first Keynote session](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/talk/A93JWF/) starts on Thursday at 9:30 and both speakers, Carol Chen and Cedric Clyburn are long time supporters of DevConf and both delivered sessions at past conferences. This time their topic is focused on openness in AI, something that they’ve been discussing extensively within different communities, collected questions and also lots of opinions and possible solutions. How do I trust a model? How do I validate it? How do I integrate it with my open source project? What other challenges may I face in the AI world? We will hopefully get these answers either at the keynote or during the AI track that follows.

### Panel discussion: AI Next Door - Meet the Masterminds Shaping AI Innovation

On the same day, we’ll run an [AI panel discussion](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/talk/9S7NHZ/) with representatives of different projects and efforts. We intentionally picked folks from the Czech Republic, to also give the whole discussion a local vibe and show that some of these cool things are happening just “next door” - [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/panel-discussion-ai-next-door-meet-masterminds-shaping-radek-vok%C3%A1l-typoe/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/panel-discussion-ai-next-door-meet-masterminds-shaping-radek-vok%C3%A1l-typoe/) . Come back from your lunch early, because this session starts at 12:30!

### 2nd Day Keynote - Revolutionize your OS deploy and management with bootc containers

[Our second day opening keynote](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/talk/YT9CKK/) starts again at 9:30am, this time on Friday morning. With this one, we want to show you that there are still interesting things happening in the OS space. There are new ideas and ways how to manage our OS, make it easier to upgrade and manage which opens up new opportunities for where it could be used - would that be edge, automotive, telco and special appliances. [The Bootc project](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) gets me excited, because it has a lot of potential. Alessandro Rosi and Luca Ferrari are both closely working with users who are champions of these specialized use cases. I hope to learn more about this, what the typical and ideal use cases are, but also what  the implications on the rest of the OS and the workflows are.
