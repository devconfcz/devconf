DevConf.CZ has always welcomed first-time speakers as well as seasoned pros. If you're a&nbsp;first-time speaker or just want to make sure you learn as much as possible before submitting a&nbsp;proposal, you're at the right place! We're going to cover all you need to know to get your proposal accepted at DevConf.CZ 2024.

## Don't miss the deadline

First and foremost, make sure you submit your proposal on time and sooner rather than later. The DevConf.CZ 2024 **[Call for Proposals](https://pretalx.com/devconf-cz-2024/cfp) ends on March 3, 2024 EOD.** We always remind the date on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@devconf_cz) and [X](https://twitter.com/devconf_cz) and you can also make sure you have the latest information on [our website](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) and [Matrix server](https://matrix.to/#/#2024:devconf.cz).

## Make it relevant and engaging

DevConf.CZ 2024 is built around [a&nbsp;list of themes](https://www.devconf.info/cz/#themes) we believe are attractive for attendees as well as speakers but we're also open to other high-quality talk suggestions. We are interested in technical sessions and speakers who are not afraid to dive deep into details of the area of their interest. Sessions with a&nbsp;lot of audience interactions and demos are highly encouraged. We're not looking for an overview or high-level topics. Make sure to avoid product pitches and marketing presentations.

Those with a&nbsp;keen eye for detail might have noticed the crystal ball in DevConf.CZ logo. The motto of the conference is “**\#define future**” and the future is what we're interested in. We'd like to see emerging topics that might hit mainstream engineering in 1-2 years. Talking about new and upcoming work generally increases your chance of acceptance.

There is a&nbsp;range of questions about the speaker and content in the CfP form. The title and abstract are the most important aspects of your submission as they are the primary focus of the Reviewing Committee and they become the most prominent part that will attract attendees during the conference. In case the Reviewing Committee needs further clarification, they will reach out to you during the reviewing period (after the CfP is closed).

## Select the right session type

While we plan DevConf.cz 2024 as a&nbsp;hybrid event, please note that **all sessions will be delivered in person**. We plan to stream content online and make sure in-person as well as online audiences can participate in Q&A and chat. We want to make sure the content is focused, tells the whole story, and is structured in a&nbsp;way that allows engagement for both in-person and virtual audiences.

* **Talk (35 minutes)** - A&nbsp;talk is where you present with slides and demos to an audience. We recommend reserving some time in the end for Q&A, e.g. a&nbsp;25-minute talk and a&nbsp;10-minute Q&A. Feel free to recruit your colleagues to interact with people in chat while you are talking. A&nbsp;talk has one primary speaker, optionally another (secondary) speaker. It should be bite-sized and focused on a&nbsp;certain topic. This means that you should not expect to be able to cover multiple broad areas in one talk. You can submit more than one proposal, to cover a&nbsp;set of topics, but we cannot guarantee their final scheduled order. Therefore, we recommend you submit topics that are independent and do not need to be presented in a&nbsp;specific order.
* **Discussion (35 minutes)** - A&nbsp;discussion is where you lead/moderate a&nbsp;conversation with a&nbsp;group of knowledgeable panelists who answer prepared questions or questions from the audience as selected by you for appropriateness to your topic and session goal. A&nbsp;discussion has a&nbsp;dedicated moderator and up to 3 active speakers. It is an interactive session and you’re asked to engage with the audience during the session.
* **Lightning talk (15 minutes)** - A&nbsp;lightning talk is a&nbsp;short presentation focused on getting people interested in something new. The goal of the lightning talk is to convey key information in a&nbsp;clear and concise manner. Smaller technical topics, project introductions, and research/thesis topic introductions are great topics for lightning talks. Lightning talks are presented back-to-back, do not require slides and do not include Q&A.
* **Two-part session (35+35 minutes)** - If you require more than 35 minutes to cover a&nbsp;certain topic, there is an option to submit a&nbsp;two-part session (two 35-minute time slots with a&nbsp;10-minute break in between) where we guarantee the order in the schedule. You should consider that different audiences may join each part and tailor the content accordingly. This option is recommended for deep technical dives that include a&nbsp;demo. You will be asked to specify why you require more time, each case will be evaluated individually.
* **Workshop (80 minutes)** - A&nbsp;workshop is a&nbsp;hands-on demo where you and other workshop leads interact with the audience with the goal to share your knowledge and experience on a&nbsp;particular bite-sized topic. The goal of a&nbsp;workshop is to teach or practice a&nbsp;skill. As a&nbsp;result, workshops should be actionable and goal-oriented. We allow up to 3 active presenters in a&nbsp;workshop.
* **Meetups (80 minutes)** - Meetups are organized as in-person meetings. They are open to all participants, and they serve as a&nbsp;place for open discussions during the dedicated time, sharing the latest project developments and interaction with contributors and attendees. We allow up to 3 active presenters in a&nbsp;meetup.
* **Activity (80 minutes)** - Activities are organized as non-technical meetups. They are open to all participants, and they serve as a great place to engage with other attendees outside of the hallway track and conference sessions. They usually center around various hobbies and interests. We hosted a candy swap session, a coffee lovers meetup, and a yoga session in the past.
* **Booths (all day)** - A&nbsp;booth is a&nbsp;staffed table at the event. Booths are open to all participants at all times, and they serve as a&nbsp;place for conversations about the project and interaction with contributors, users, and attendees. There must be at least one person at the booth at all times. Preference is given to booths that will run all three days.
